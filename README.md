## 🎯 Purpose
Encourage reduced screen time, improved focus, and continuous personal growth by rewarding time spent away from the screen.  
BeeProductive turns mindfulness into motivation.

## 🧠 Core Concept
- Time spent **off the screen** generates rewards.  
- Users grow and maintain a **bee colony** 🐝 — hive growth and honey 🍯 reflect progress.  
- Excessive screen time causes bees to **leave** or slows hive productivity.


## 🕹️ Gamification
- **🐝 Bee Colony Growth:** Earn bees, honey, and hive upgrades for staying screen-free.  
- **🌸 Positive Feedback:** Hive expands visually as users improve habits.  
- **💀 Negative Feedback:** Bees leave or hive slows when phone use increases.  
- **🎯 Personal Challenges:** User-set goals (e.g., “Stay under 3 hours today”).  
- **🤝 Group Challenges:** Shared goals for friends or custom groups.


## 👥 Social Features
- **🏆 Leaderboards:** Compare hive growth and productivity with friends and groups.  
- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Groups:** Join or create groups to collaborate on challenges and motivate each other.

## 🌟 Goals
- 📉 Reduce overall screen time.  
- 🧘 Promote mindful and intentional phone use.  
- 🔁 Encourage constant self-improvement.  
- 🎮 Make the process fun, visual, and rewarding.


## ⚙️ Key Principles
- 💬 **Motivational** — focuses on positive reinforcement, not restriction.  
- 🎨 **Simple & Engaging UI** — clean visuals, friendly animations.
