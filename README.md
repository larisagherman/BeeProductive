# 🐝 BeeProductive

**Standalone Android app** that helps users build healthier phone habits through 🕹️ gamification and 👥 social interaction.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Encourage reduced screen time, improved focus, and continuous personal growth by rewarding time spent away from the screen.  
BeeProductive turns mindfulness into motivation.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept
- Time spent **off the screen** generates rewards.  
- Users grow and maintain a **bee colony** 🐝 — hive growth and honey 🍯 reflect progress.  
- Excessive screen time causes bees to **leave** or slows hive productivity.

---

## 🕹️ Gamification
- **🐝 Bee Colony Growth:** Earn bees, honey, and hive upgrades for staying screen-free.  
- **🌸 Positive Feedback:** Hive expands visually as users improve habits.  
- **💀 Negative Feedback:** Bees leave or hive slows when phone use increases.  
- **🎯 Personal Challenges:** User-set goals (e.g., “Stay under 3 hours today”).  
- **🤝 Group Challenges:** Shared goals for friends or custom groups.

---

## 👥 Social Features
